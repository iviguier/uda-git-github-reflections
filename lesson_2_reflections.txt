What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The .git subdir gets created.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

repository houses all versions committed.  staging area is just a list
of currently uncommitted files.  Working directory contains the
repository, the uncommitted files and may contain untracked files.
