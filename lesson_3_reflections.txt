When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

When working with other folks, or when working from multiple machines.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There could be situations where you're working on something that someone
else is working on.  Automatic syncs could make things more confusing.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?

fork = make a fork of someone else's repository on github. use it to
"have your own copy" of a repo to work on.
clone = make a copy of a remote to your local. Use it to do actual work
branch = start new stream of modifications (commits) for, e.g., new
features.



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

Discontinuities in connectivity.



How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

Tediously and painfully.  Shared drives, other VCSs, email....
