When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

When working with other folks, or when working from multiple machines.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There could be situations where you're working on something that someone
else is working on.  Automatic syncs could make things more confusing.
